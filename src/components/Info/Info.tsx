        <p>Hearts United, is an organization that provides low-income families in 3rd world countries with the resources and skills that will empower them to be successful and catalyst members of their communities through education, medical, and nutritional assistance. We wish to create a community that is self-sufficient in and of themselves with very limited assistance from outside organizations. By doing this "Hearts United Foundation" makes a difference in the lives of these families in Latin America by providing a way out of the poverty that has enslaved them so long. God has placed this vision in our hearts, and he has made the need of these families so tangible in our spirits that we can no longer ignore their suffering and wish to act on the desire God has placed within us.</p>
